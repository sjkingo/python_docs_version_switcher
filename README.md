# Python Docs Version Switcher extension

This is an extension for Google Chrome that allows you to persistently set the
version on `docs.python.org` to use. For instance, setting it to `3.5` and then
browsing to the docs for `2.7` will automatically redirect you to the version
you specified.

## Installation

Simply download the extension (version 1.0) and run it in chrome:

```bash
$ google-chome python_docs_version_switcher.crx
```

No warranty is given - use at your own risk!

Tested on Google Chrome 44 beta (Linux) but should work anywhere.
