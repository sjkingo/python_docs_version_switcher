# Python Docs Version Switcher extension

This is an extension for Google Chrome that allows you to persistently set the
version on `docs.python.org` to use. For instance, setting it to `3.5` and then
browsing to the docs for `2.7` will automatically redirect you to the version
you specified.

## Installation

1. [Download the extension](https://github.com/sjkingo/python_docs_version_switcher/releases/download/1.0/python_docs_version_switcher.crx)
2. Open the Chrome Extensions page and drag the extension in and drop it on the page.
3. You will see a popup asking if you wish to install the extension.

Tested on Google Chrome 44 beta (Linux) but should work anywhere.
